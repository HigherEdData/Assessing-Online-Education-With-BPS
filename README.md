# Assessing Online Education with Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Survey Data

### By Amber Villalobos

Summary: We use the 12/17 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Survey Restricted Data to analyze the effects of attending online degree programs on students' educational and loan debt outcomes. 

**Data**
  - BPS Derived Student File
  - BPS School Information File

A preanalysis plan is available here: https://osf.io/274we

This repository will be updated in June 2022. As the data are restricted, the STATA code and notebooks must undergo disclosure review at NCES for approval prior to public dissemination. 

If you would like to edit and execute the .ipynb NoteBook files but do not have Jupyter, you can use the following instructions prepared by Derek Devnich for installing Git, Jupyter, and the STATA Kernel for Jupyter:

Install Git: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/git/install
Install the Anaconda distribution of Python. This will also install Jupyter Lab: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/python/install
Configure Jupyter Lab to use the STATA kernel: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/python/stata
